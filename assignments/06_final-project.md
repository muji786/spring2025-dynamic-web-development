### Part 2: Deployment
* Your source code is pushed to a repository on GitHub
* Your web application is deployed to Heroku
  * Your `package.json` should list all of the necessary npm libraries in order for you application to run in `dependencies`. Make sure you have a `start` script (`"start": "node server.js"`)
