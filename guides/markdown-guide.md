# Markdown Guide

## About

This is a guide to markdown. 

See accompanying video tutorial here: [Markdown demo with atom.io and markdown preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cpwhFHE6hc&list=PLqN0DSYPddBT4-meaRliR3lxVon0IFIza)

## Syntax

now here's the best part.

I'm writing text, nothing special. BUT but but, if we start using "markdown" syntax, we can start transforming text into "styled" text.

# for example, I'm a header 1

## i'm a header 2

### I'm a header 3

#### I'm a header 4

Isn't that neat?

You might be wondering, what other syntactical syntactics might be available?

Let's check out some other stuff.

* one
* two
* threeeee!

^^ see that's a list up there


These carets make these cool grey "quotes"

> here's a super cool quote that you might want to use sometimes to differentiate your text.


There are other commands like showing "code blocks"


you can use these backticks:

```
everything
inside
here

will take the formatting you
tell it to
```


you can even tell which language you want your code to render in like this:


```js

var happy = true
var unhappy = false


function greetings(input){
  return "i am" + input
}
```

See those pretty colors?


Ok, what else do we have? We can make cool links like this:

You can also add images like this:


![I'm the alt text for an image](https://news.psu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/threshold-992/public/hockeystick.gif?itok=d3wvICuj)

Magic!!! 🌈


See, you can add lots of stuff on a page in a structured way using markdown.


It's fast, renders nicely in the browser, and it's flat text, so none of this crazy binary stuff that gets all garbly.

# now go forth and markdown your life! 🙆‍♂️ 🌴🌈


Thanks for watching!
