# Dynamic Web Development - ITPG-GT.2577.1
## Spring 2024

# Welcome to 7 weeks of development

Instructor: Ahmad Arshad

Email Address: ahmad.arshad@nyu.edu

Live Sessions: Fri 9:30AM - 12:00PM EST

Dates : 03/15/2024 - 05/03/2024

Location : 370 Jay St, Room 408 Loc: Brooklyn Campus

## DESCRIPTION
This online synchronous course introduces the fundamentals of building "full stack" web applications. It will focus on modern, client- and server- side web technologies and provide practical methods for approaching web development for creative and functional applications. The core technologies used in this course are HTML5, JavaScript, Node.js with the Express framework, and MongoDB database. Students will learn to design, develop, and deploy web applications and gain the necessary skills to extend and explore web development independently.

## OBJECTIVES
By the end of the class, you should have a good understanding of the following concepts:

* Full-Stack Javascript - Familiarity with both client-side and server-side Javascript.
* UI/UX Design - Creating wireframes and style guides, and translating them to code.
* Designing Data-Driven Applications - How to design and build a 'full-stack' data application.
* Using APIs - How to interact with and use an API from within your client application.
* Structuring Data - How to intelligently structure data.
* Storing Data - How to build systems to store your own data.
* Building APIs - How to build your own APIs and make the data available to client applications.
* Deploying full stack applications - Deploying applications using Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS) with Git/GitHub, Glitch

## OUTCOMES
In order to achieve these objectives, students will spend the semester building, refactoring, getting feedback and iterating on, one project throughout the course. The interactive web application will require students to exercise each of the key skills taught throughout this course as well as equip students with the skills to continue developing new dynamic web applications after the course.

Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:
* 20% Attendance/Participation
* 50% Assignments
* 10% Project Proposal
* 20% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course
* TOTAL: 100%

Please see ITP's statement on [Pass/Fail](https://itp.nyu.edu/help/) which states that a "Pass" is equivalent to an "A" or a "B" while anything less would be considered a "Fail".

Here's an outline of how your assignments and final will generally be evaluated. The explaners of each category are rough guidelines for how I assign numbers (or quantify ðŸ˜‰) to the work you are producing in this class.

| Category | 1 - 2 pts | 3 - 4 pts | 5 - 6 pts | 7 - 8 pts | 9 - 10 pts |
| :------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Quality**  | The work is handed in late, broken, incomplete, undocumented, or shows lack of care or thought | The work is only partially documented and seems only partially complete | The work is documented and represents the student's concept and shows good effort | The work is well documented, thoughtful, and professional | The work shows mastery and is well polished |
| **Understanding** | There is either no substance or the student cannot explain or justify decision making | The work shows partial grasp of the concepts, but shows major gaps that could be addressed with more thought | The work is sensible and grounded and can be explained in a coherent manner | The work represents the concept well, references past and current work. The student can speak to more than 1 perspective. | The work shows strong graps of concepts and the state-of-the-art. The work is well received in both concept and implementation |
| **Application** | The work reflects very little conceptual references to the course materials; a general lack of awareness to methodology and implementation | The work applies methodology(ies) that have some potential, but not quite relevant or effective | The work uses methods that are appropriate and thoughtful. The application of methods are standard and show good potential | The work uses methods that are appropriate, thoughtful, and well implemented. There are innovative ideas that are shown in the application. | There work shows careful methodological considerations and is beautifully crafted, designed, and presented. |

## GIT REPOSITORY
It is expected that everyone in the class create and maintain a git repository that includes your weekly assignments.

Be sure to enter your name, preferred email address, and the URL on the class site

## ATTENDANCE
As this class is primarliy face to face, attendance is required. 

## CLASS PARTICIPATION
You are expected to participate in class and give feedback to other students and participate with their projects. Class Participation will count towars 20% of the grade

## FINAL PROJECTS
Class will culminate final projects. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the class that is useful in some manner to yourself or the world. This will comprise 80% of your grade.

#### LATE ASSIGNMENTS:

Late assignments **will not be accepted** except under special circumstances or with a doctors note. 

If you have not "finished" your assignment you still must submit what you have done to the appropriate assignment submission google form. You can improve on your submitted assignent after submission, BUT your work will not be reviewed if it is passed the deadline.

### STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Plagiarism is presenting someone elseâ€™s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writerâ€™s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

### STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE
The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members. It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice. Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards. For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: https://tisch.nyu.edu/student-affairs/important-resources/tisch-policies-and-handbooks
