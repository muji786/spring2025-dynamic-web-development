# Feedback and Critique Guide


via The Atlantic, [Mr. Rogers Had a Simple Set of Rules for Talking to Children](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/)

Per the pamphlet, there were nine steps for translating into Freddish:

* “State the idea you wish to express as clearly as possible, and in terms preschoolers can understand.” 
	- Example: It is dangerous to play in the street. ​​​​​​
* “Rephrase in a positive manner,” 
	- as in It is good to play where it is safe.
* “Rephrase the idea, bearing in mind that preschoolers cannot yet make subtle distinctions and need to be redirected to authorities they trust.” 
	- As in, “Ask your parents where it is safe to play.”
* “Rephrase your idea to eliminate all elements that could be considered prescriptive, directive, or instructive.” 
	- In the example, that’d mean getting rid of “ask”: Your parents will tell you where it is safe to play.
* “Rephrase any element that suggests certainty.” That’d be “will”: 
	- Your parents can tell you where it is safe to play.
* “Rephrase your idea to eliminate any element that may not apply to all children.” 
	- Not all children know their parents, so: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play.
* “Add a simple motivational idea that gives preschoolers a reason to follow your advice.” 
	- Perhaps: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is good to listen to them.
* “Rephrase your new statement, repeating the first step.” “Good” represents a value judgment, 
	- so: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is important to try to listen to them.
* “Rephrase your idea a ﬁnal time, relating it to some phase of development a preschooler can understand.” 
	- Maybe: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play. It is important to try to listen to them, and listening is an important part of growing.

## Giving Criticism

A short guide for offering constructive criticism, pulled from Golan Levin and Tega Brain's forthcoming book, _Code as Creative Medium: A Teacher's Manual_:

1. Description: What do you see?
2. Analysis: How is it made? What does it make you think about or feel?
3. Interpretation: What is it about? What is the main idea being explored?
4. Evaluation: Is it successful? Does it explore the prompt in a compelling, interesting or unique way?

## Receiving Criticism

Receiving criticism is a skill to develop alongside giving criticism. We are all giving time and energy to help each other with our work, so how can you receive critical feedback as generosity? How can you separate you, as an individual, and your identity from your work? 

It's also an important skill to be able to sort what is useful for you and what is not. It can sometimes be hard and triggering to receive criticism, and that's something to be mindful of as well. Here are some  "rules of the road" for receiving criticism, adapted from _The Artist's Way_ by Julia Cameron. 

1. Receive the criticism all the way through and get it over with.
2. Jot down notes to yourself on what concepts or phrases bother you.
3. Jot down notes on what concepts or phrases seem useful.
4. Do something very nuturing for yourself—read an old good review or recall a compliment.
5. Remember that even if you have made a truly rotten piece of art, it may be _necessary_ stepping-stone to your next work. Art matures spasmodically and _requires_ ugly-ducking growth stages.
6. Look at the criticism again. Does it remind of you any criticism from your past?
7. Write a letter to the critic—not to be mailed, most probably. Defend your work _and_ acknowledge what was helpful, if anything, in the criticism proffered.
8. Get back on the horse. Make an immediate commitment to do something creative.
9. Do it. Creativity is the only cure for criticism.
