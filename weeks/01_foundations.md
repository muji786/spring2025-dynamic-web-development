## About
This week, we will be starting out journey as developers of the web. 

As part of this week's lecture and discussion, we will go through a (very) quick history of the web and define some important concepts and definitions related to the internet and web development. 

A majority of the class will be focused on setting up your development environments and getting you into the practice of developing and deploying web applications through your first assignment.

### How the Internet Works
When we're creating websites and web applications, it's helpful to understand the infrastructure of the Internet. This helps us understand all of the steps in creating a website from scratch.

What is the Internet? It's a global network of computers connected to each other. They're not all directly connected to each other, which would look something like this:

<img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8443/internet-schema-2.png" width="300" alt="Naive incorrect Internet diagram" />

Instead, computers are connected to intermediary routers, provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) (e.g. AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Spectrum, etc), whose only job is to direct messages from one computer to another. 

<img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8453/internet-schema-7.png" alt="Accurate Internet diagram with ISP routers" width="300">

The Internet is different from the World Wide Web (WWW), which is the collection of information that can be accessed via the Internet. You can think of a library building as the Internet, and the books stored in the library as the world wide web.

Each computer has a unique IP (Internet Protocol) address, which you can think of like a street address. How would you be able to get mail if your address weren't unique? These addresses are of the form **nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn**, where nnn is a number from 0-255 (2^8 - 1).

![Two computers connected to the Internet with unique IP addresses](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper_files/ruswp_diag1.gif)

When you navigate to a url in your browser, how is this translated to a website on the world wide web? A special type of computer, called a server, is holding all of the data and files necessary to make that website work. When you navigate to a url, your request is routed to the appropriate server, which gives you back all of the data you need. These are all of the steps:
1. You enter a URL into your browser, e.g. https://neopets.com. This url is called a "domain name". 
2. The browser converts the domain name into an IP address using a DNS (Domain Name Server). This special type of server contains a database that maps domain names to IP address.
3. Your browser sends a HTTP request to the computer at the returned IP address. HTTP stands for Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol, and it is the language that browsers and web servers speak to each other in.
4. The web server sends back an HTTP response, containing the website's HTML (Hyper-text Markup Language) document. Every single website has an HTML document which contains the structure of the web page, and also lists any additional resources the browser needs to request.
5. Your browser starts rendering the HTML, converting the HTML code to visual elements, known as the DOM (Document Object Model).
6. Your browser requests any additional resources linked to in the HTML, i.e. images, videos, javascript files, css, and repeats steps 3-5.
7. Once the website is loaded, your browser executes any JavaScript scripts, which could things like modify the DOM or make additional HTTP requests.

There's a couple of other specifics about how requests and servers work. When computers communicate with each other over the Internet, they also communicate over specific ports. These are a number between 0-65535 (2^16 - 1). The port specifies which application or service to connect to on a server. Computers run lots of applications at once, so the port is crucial to knowing which one to connect to. Ports are appended to the end of an IP address, i.e. **nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn:pppp**. When you navigate to a website, often the port is implicit; for example, https://neopets.com:443 is the same as https://neopets.com. The IP address with the port, of the format nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn:pppp is called a **socket**. 

Applications that are running on a computer, that are waiting for HTTP requests on a specific port are called **web servers**. It's confusing that the word server can refer to a physical computer connected to the Internet, and also a piece of software that returns HTML/JavaScript/CSS/JSON/etc. In this class we will primarily be talking about servers as a software application. 

We will eventually be creating web servers that run on our own computers. How do we access them from a browser? Your local computer has a special IP address, **127.0.0.1**, which is aliased to "localhost". When we create these web servers, we'll give them a specific port too, usually something like 8000 or 8080.

Additional notes on how web browsers work cna be found in the [Browser Guide](/guides/browser-guide.md)

### Modern Web Applications
Web applications have lots of different components, but they are primarily composed of:
- Front end: Also known as client side code, this is the code that runs within a browser, which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media. This code is sent from a web server but is not executed there. 
- Back end: Also known as server-side code, this is the code that runs on a hardware server connected to the Internet. This code could be Python, Ruby, Rust, Haskell, etc. but in the context of this class is JavaScript running in Node.js.
- Database: This stores and persists your website's data. This can be a lot of information! The back end will typically fetch a portion of this data to send to the front end (e.g. if you went to the Wikipedia page for "Capybara", the backend would fetch the "Capybara" entry in the database and nothing else). In this class we will be using MongoDB. 

When we create web applications, we run and test these different components on our local computer. When we are happy with what we have and ready to put it on the internet, we need to transfer this code to a computer that can serve files to the internet. This process is called **deployment**. Many companies provide servers that you can transfer your website files to, this is called **hosting**. These companies include Digital Ocean, AWS, and Google; for this class we will be using Glitch.com and Heroku. 


### Development Tools
In order to create websites and web applications, we use different tools to write, test, and deploy our code. These are called **development tools**. There are many different choices of tools; however, the ones we will go over in this class are used by many professional web developers and are the preferred tools of your instructors Cassie and Joey.

#### Text Editor

![Screenshot of VS Code Text Editor](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.visualstudio.com%2Fopengraphimg%2Fopengraph-home.png&f=1&nofb=1)

A text editor is an application in which you can create and edit text files. It's different from an application like Microsoft Word, in that it's specifically for writing code, rather than English. It's the place you write your HTML/JS/etc. files. 

In this class we will be using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It comes with a ton of features to make writing code easier, including tons of syntax highlighting and tons of extensions.

#### Command Line

![Terminal Window](../assets/terminal-01.png)

Have you ever opened the "Terminal" application (or maybe "Windows Command Prompt") on your computer? This is called a **command line interface**. You're probably used to interacting with your computer using its GUI (Graphical User Interface), made up of icons, windows, dropdown menus, and other visual components, which you use to perform actions on your computer. The command line is a different interface to your computer, in which you can only tell your computer what to do using text commands. Sometimes it can be frustrating to interact with your computer using the command line, but it gives you access to tools you can't use from the GUI. Many of the tools used to create web applications can only be used on the command line, therefore it's important to learn how to use it.

See the [command line guide](../guides/commandline.md) to get starting using the command line.

#### Version Control

![Git Branching Screenshot](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAN7Rue-4aMo%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

When working on a piece of writing, it's common to make many drafts before settling on a final version. The same thing happens when you write software. Version control software keeps track of all of the changes you make, and stores them in a "ledger". It also helps you collaborate with other people—you can see the changes that you made, and ones that another person made. It's a pretty powerful tool, and invaluable when writing code.

The most widely used version control software is **Git**. In this class we will be using git as a command line tool. See [git guide](../guides/git.md) for an in-depth guide to getting started with git.

#### Source Code Hosting

![Github Logo Octocat](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechnologyconversations.files.wordpress.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fgithub.png%3Fw%3D625&f=1&nofb=1)

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a website for hosting and exploring source code. Many open source projects are hosted on this site, from [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js). We'll be using it in this class to host our code (and the git revision history) online. At first, we will use GitHub Desktop to push our **git repository** to GitHub, but mainly we will be using git from the command line.

#### Deployment & Deployment Options

![Glitch Homepage](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Findysigner%2Fimage%2Ffetch%2Ff_auto%2Cq_auto%2Fw_400%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fcloud.netlifyusercontent.com%2Fassets%2F344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629%2F4967a5fd-69eb-4514-9025-f45e888aa15e%2Fvr-endless-runner-game-1-p1-s1.png&f=1&nofb=1)

Once we're ready to make our web application public, we can deploy it. This is different from putting your code on GitHub, as this is a site for looking at the course code, versus the application that is created when the source code is executed. For this class we will be using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) and later on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

See the [guide to importing a git repository to Glitch](https://help.glitch.com/kb/article/20-importing-code-from-github/) for a guide to deployment.

**NOTE**: Glitch is also an in browser code editor (like the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)). However, for this class we will be writing all of our code locally, then pushing to GitHub, then importing your GitHub repository to Glitch.
